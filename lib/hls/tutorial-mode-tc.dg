#enter-conversation
(tutorial suggestion *)
(can perform * with $Who)
    ~(conversation partner $)
    *(animate $Who)
    (player can see $Who)
    ~(ignored by tutorial $Who)
    %% This may need some refinement
    *(quip $Quip)
    ($Who can discuss $Quip)
(* is performed by [talk to $])
(suggest * with $Who)
    There are other characters about, such as (the $Who).
    We can strike up a conversation with them, with
    (suggest command [talk to $Who])
    \(or
    (suggest command [hello $Who])\).

#make-conversation
(tutorial suggestion *)
(can perform * with [$NPC $Quip])
    (conversation partner $NPC)
    (discussable quips $Quips)
    *($Quip is one of $Quips)
    %% Picky here because otherwise much of the suggestion will be 
    (asking quip $Quip)
    ~(about $Quip)
    ($Quip is discussable with $NPC)
(* is performed by [discuss quip $])
(suggest * with [$NPC $Quip])
    (collect words)
        (name $Quip)
    (into $QuipWords)
    Conversations take the form of connect series of questions or statements between you
    and another character in the world
    
    (par)Here you could
    (suggest command [ask $NPC  | $QuipWords]), or 
    \(because you are already talking to (the $NPC)\)
    (suggest command [ask | $QuipWords]).  In fact, you can just type some or all of the suggested topic,
    %% This is tricky, if because that last word may be ambiguous, in which case, the game author
    %% should mark the quips as ignored, or provide a command name to the quip.
    (suggest command [$Quip]) and the game will figure out that it's part of the ongoing conversation.
(* is performed by [perform quip $])
(narrate after suggestion *)
    After each exchange, you are provided with a list of other things you might say
    to continue the subject. There may be further topics you can discuss, however, that
    are not suggested for puzzle or narrative reasons.
