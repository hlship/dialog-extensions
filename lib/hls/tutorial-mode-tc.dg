#enter-conversation
(tutorial suggestion *)
(can perform * with $Who)
    ~(conversation partner $)
    *(animate $Who)
    (player can see $Who)
    ~(ignored by tutorial $Who)
    %% This may need some refinement
    *(quip $Quip)
    ($Who can discuss $Quip)
(* is performed by [talk to $])
(suggest * with $Who)
    There are other characters about, such as (the $Who).
    We can strike up a conversation with them, with
    (suggest command [talk to $Who])
    \(or
    (suggest command [hello $Who])\).

#make-conversation
(tutorial suggestion *)
(can perform * with [$NPC $Quip])
    (conversation partner $NPC)
    (discussable quips $Quips)
    *($Quip is one of $Quips)
    %% Picky here because otherwise much of the suggestion will be 
    (asking quip $Quip)
    ~(about $Quip)
    ($Quip is discussable with $NPC)
(* is performed by [discuss quip $])
(suggest * with [$NPC $Quip])
    (collect words)
        (name $Quip)
    (into $QuipWords)
    Conversations take the form of connect series of questions or statements between you
    and another character in the world
    
    (par)Here you could
    (suggest command [ask $NPC  | $QuipWords]), or 
    \(because you are already talking to (the $NPC)\)
    you don't have to mention their name, and can just
    (suggest command [ask | $QuipWords]).  
    
    (par)
    In fact, you can just type some or all of the words in the suggested topic,
    %% This is tricky, if because that last word may be ambiguous, in which case, the game author
    %% should mark the quips as ignored, or provide a command name to the quip.
    (suggest command [$Quip]), and the game will figure out that it's part of the ongoing conversation.
(* is performed by [perform quip $])
(narrate after suggestion *)
    After each exchange, you are provided with a list of other things you might say
    to continue the subject \(if there are any\). There may also be further topics you can discuss, however, that
    are not suggested for puzzle or narrative reasons.
