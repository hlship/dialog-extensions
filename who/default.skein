Outside The Lamp And The Egg Pub
You're on a narrow cobblestone path that threads between closely-set, squat
stone houses. It's just after sunset and, and in the dimness, you can make out a
number of doors, all closed, and a few windows, all barricaded behind sturdy
shutters.

The exception is the pub itself; through the somewhat dusty panes of the window
you can make out a hint of light and movement.

The coolness following the setting sun has caused a light mist to form.

[This game has a built-in tutorial mode for players new to interactive fiction;
it suggests common commands that you can try. You can turn this off with 
tutorial off or back on with tutorial on.]

You glance down down with the odd feeling that you'll be surprised by what you
see. You are a tall, lean figure, with a shock of white hair over a clean-shaven
and somewhat long face.

[You are carrying your frilly jacket; you can leave it here with drop jacket.]

with condensation on the inside, and the outside surface is a blaze of nearly
microscopic scratches and pits. Even so, you can sense some warmth and movement
inside.

A moment slips away.

[The world consists of distinct locations you can visit. You started in Outside
The Lamp And The Egg Pub, but could go east (or just east) to move to a
different location.

Direction names include the eight cardinal directions (north, northeast, east,
etc.) as well as up, down, in, and out.

Finally, you can abbreviate most directions: n for north, ne for northeast, and
so forth.]

You walk east through the pub door.

Inside the Pub
The pub's interior matches your every expectation. Dark wood, a well polished
bar, several deep booths. Despite the early hour and chill outside, the pub is
empty but for the bartender endlessly polishing the bar.

[The world is not on a perfect grid; sometimes you go east, and return to where
you started by going south (not west). Sometimes a direction is a one-way trip,
and you have to find an entirely different route back to where you started, if
that is even possible.]

The bartender glances up and gives you a welcoming nod before returning to his
polishing efforts.

Younger than you'd think, he wears a lightly stained apron, and has rolled up
the sleeves of his button-down shirt. He never seems to stop moving, even though
he also seems rooted in place.

[There are other characters about, such as the bartender. We can strike up a
conversation with them, with talk to bartender (or hello bartender).]

You catch the bartender's eye, and he's eager to engage with his only customer.

You could ask where everyone is.

[Conversations take the form of connect series of questions or statements
between you and another character in the world

Here you could ask bartender where everyone is, or (because you are already
talking to the bartender) ask where everyone is. In fact, you can just type some
or all of the suggested topic, everyone and the game will figure out that it's
part of the ongoing conversation.]

"Hey mate," you say, approaching the bar, "awfully quiet night in here, isn't
it?"

[After each exchange, you are provided with a list of other things you might say
to continue the subject. There may be other things you can discuss, however,
that are not mentioned for puzzle or narrative reasons.]

"Right you are sir!" he says, with just a note of agitation. "Been like this for
too long, I say. But it's not like folks are going to go all dry, is it?" He
thinks for a moment. "Things will pick up, soon enough; they have to."
