Outside The Lamp And The Egg Pub
You're on a narrow cobblestone path running north and south that threads between
closely-set, squat stone houses. It's just after sunset, and in the dimness, you
can make out a number of doors, all closed, and a few windows, all barricaded
behind sturdy shutters.

The exception is the pub on the east side of the path; under a rather involved
bit of signage is quite the formidable door. Through the somewhat dusty panes of
the flanking windows you can make out a hint of light and movement.

The coolness following the setting sun has caused a light mist to form.

[This game has a built-in tutorial mode for players new to interactive fiction;
it suggests common commands that you can try. You can turn this off with 
tutorial off or back on with tutorial on.]

You walk east through the pub door.

Inside the Pub
The pub's interior matches your every expectation. Dark wood, a well polished
bar, several deep booths. Despite the early hour and chill outside, the pub is
empty but for the bartender endlessly polishing the bar. Through a low overhang,
an ancient and likely structural wooden beam, you can see a few flashing lights
from the room to the north.

[The world is not on a perfect grid; sometimes you go east, and return to where
you started by going south (not west). Sometimes a direction is a one-way trip,
and you have to find an entirely different route back to where you started, if
that is even possible.]

The bartender glances up and gives you a welcoming nod before returning to his
polishing efforts.

talking to the Bartender) you don't have to mention their name, and can just ask
where everyone is.

In fact, you can just type some or all of the words in the suggested topic, 
everyone, and the game will figure out that it's part of the ongoing

"Hey mate," you say, approaching the bar, "awfully quiet night in here, isn't

[After each exchange, you are provided with a list of other things you might say
to continue the subject (if there are any). There may also be further topics you
can discuss, however, that are not suggested for puzzle or narrative reasons.]

"Right you are sir!" he says, with just a note of agitation. "Been like this for
too long, I say. But it's not like folks are going to go all dry, is it?" He
thinks for a moment. "Things will pick up, soon enough; they have to."

You bend down quite low to squeeze under the wooden beam as you make your way
into the game room.

"If it's all right with you, sir," the Bartender says, "I'll just stay here and
keep an eye on the door. I can hear you fine on a quiet night like this. I'm
sure we'll have a little more company in here, soon enough." You don't think he
quite believes it, either.

Game Room
The main attraction of this room is a huge billiards table, centered in the
small space. Arrayed around this centerpiece are a few also-rans: a sad little
dartboard on the far side of the table from the rest of the pub, and a strange
little machine on a small shelf wedged into one corner.

The bartender watches you expectantly from the his preferred spot behind the
bar.

A cacacaphony of bells, chimes, and buzzers surge from the strange little
machine.

You could ask where everyone is, say that the machine is quite noisy, or say no
need to shout.

[Some objects, such as the billiards table, are big enough for you to stand on.
Try climb table.]

The beam itself, though large, is non-descript. It's position speaks to the
considerable age of the pub; the game room almost certainly had a different
purpose, originally, and was likely not connected to the pub.

The gambling machine plays a triumpant fanfare, all buzzy electronic trumpets,
then makes a sound like a bucketful of coins spilling into its tray.

A billiards table from a older, more grandious era, it is out of place in the
pub simply as a matter of its shear size and solidity. It has great legs of
carved mahogany, its blue felt is clean and unwrinkled, and the many pockets are
entirely unmarked by wear.

The little machine plays a short cascade of notes, desperately trying to get
your attention.

The machine sits on a shelf, at a height that would be comfortable if you were
seated in front of it, though you don't see a chair. There's a color video
screen that displays a frenetic kaledescope of hearts, coins, lucky clovers,
pound symbols, and other things you don't recognize. A collection of buttons on
the front apparently serve some purpose, perhaps when playing the game.

You hear the sound of rockets launching from the little machine in the corner,
and see a fireworks display animated on its screen. The explosions fade to the
word "WIN!".

A rectangular Tiffany lamp hangs from the ceiling; it is off-center with the
table below, offset by a large and somewhat battered trap door mounted into the
ceiling.

The gambling machine falls silent for a moment, as if it's exhausted from all of
its efforts to entice you to play.

In this moment of relative quiet, you can barely make out another sound... an
insistent high-pitched whine, strangely familar. The sound is muffled, as it
appears to be coming from some place above the ceiling.

getting it mucked up now then."

You obviously aren't going to climb up on the billiards table while he's
watching.

> hello bartender
You catch the bartender's eye, and he's eager to engage with his only customer.

You could ask where everyone is.

[Conversations take the form of connect series of questions or statements
between you and another character in the world

Here you could ask bartender where everyone is, or (because you are already
talking to the Bartender) you don't have to mention their name, and can just ask
where everyone is.

In fact, you can just type some or all of the words in the suggested topic, 
everyone, and the game will figure out that it's part of the ongoing
conversation.]

"That's quite all right," you say, "plenty to keep me occupied in here. We'll
chat later."

to continue the subject (if there are any). There may also be further topics you

He face reveals a mixture of annoyance and relief.

The little machine plays a short cascade of notes, desperately trying to get
your attention.

The gambling machine plays a triumpant fanfare, all buzzy electronic trumpets,
then makes a sound like a bucketful of coins spilling into its tray.

Mounted into the ceiling, next to the lamp, is a sizable trap door; you presume
it gives access to an upper floor, or more likely, a crawl-space above the game
room.

The little machine plays a short cascade of notes, desperately trying to get
your attention.

command: feel machine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> feel machine
You check around and behind the machine searching for... yes, an on/off switch
is just reachable on the back side of the machine.

The gambling machine falls silent for a moment, as if it's exhausted from all of
its efforts to entice you to play.

In this moment of relative quiet, you can barely make out another sound... an
insistent high-pitched whine, strangely familar. The sound is muffled, as it
appears to be coming from some place above the ceiling.

The board is pocked by long use. You don't see sign of any darts, however.

A cacacaphony of bells, chimes, and buzzers surge from the strange little
machine.

command: push machine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You punch at some of the buttons on the annoying machine, but nothing of note
happens.

You hear the sound of rockets launching from the little machine in the corner,
and see a fireworks display animated on its screen. The explosions fade to the
word "WIN!".

You reach behind the machine and toggle its power switch, bringing a pause to
its endless cacapony.

You can make out a muffled, electronic whine, coming from above you, past the
ceiling.

You punch at some of the buttons on the annoying machine, but nothing of note
happens. You doubt much more would happen if it were switched on.

You bend down quite low to squeeze under the wooden beam as you make your way
into the game room.

"If it's all right with you, sir," the Bartender says, "I'll just stay here and
keep an eye on the door. I can hear you fine on a quiet night like this. I'm
sure we'll have a little more company in here, soon enough." You don't think he
quite believes it, either.

Game Room
The main attraction of this room is a huge billiards table, centered in the
small space. Arrayed around this centerpiece are a few also-rans: a sad little
dartboard on the far side of the table from the rest of the pub, and a strange
little machine on a small shelf wedged into one corner.

The bartender watches you expectantly from the his preferred spot behind the
bar.

A cacacaphony of bells, chimes, and buzzers surge from the strange little
machine.

You could say that the machine is quite noisy or say no need to shout.

[Some objects, such as the billiards table, are big enough for you to stand on.
Try climb table.]

You again duck under the low beam, back into the pub proper.

Inside the Pub
The pub's interior matches your every expectation. Dark wood, a well polished
bar, several deep booths. Despite the early hour and chill outside, the pub is
empty but for the bartender endlessly polishing the bar. Through a low overhang,
an ancient and likely structural wooden beam, you can see a few flashing lights
from the room to the north.

You could say that the machine is quite noisy.
