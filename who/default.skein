Outside The Lamp And The Egg Pub
You're on a narrow cobblestone path running north and south that threads between
closely-set, squat stone houses. It's just after sunset, and in the dimness, you
can make out a number of doors, all closed, and a few windows, all barricaded
behind sturdy shutters.

The exception is the pub on the east side of the path; under a rather involved
bit of signage is quite the formidable door. Through the somewhat dusty panes of
the flanking windows you can make out a hint of light and movement.

The coolness following the setting sun has caused a light mist to form.

[This game has a built-in tutorial mode for players new to interactive fiction;
it suggests common commands that you can try. You can turn this off with 
tutorial off or back on with tutorial on.]

A moment slips away.

[The world consists of distinct locations you can visit. You started in Outside
The Lamp And The Egg Pub, but could go east (or just east) to move to a
different location.

Direction names include the eight cardinal directions (north, northeast, east,
etc.) as well as up, down, in, and out.

Finally, you can abbreviate most directions: n for north, ne for northeast, and
so forth.]

You walk east through the pub door.

Inside the Pub
The pub's interior matches your every expectation. Dark wood, a well polished
bar, several deep booths. Despite the early hour and chill outside, the pub is
empty but for the bartender endlessly polishing the bar. Through a low overhang,
an ancient and likely structural wooden beam, you can see a few flashing lights
from the room to the north.

[The world is not on a perfect grid; sometimes you go east, and return to where
you started by going south (not west). Sometimes a direction is a one-way trip,
and you have to find an entirely different route back to where you started, if
that is even possible.]

The bartender glances up and gives you a welcoming nod before returning to his
polishing efforts.

between you and another character in the world

Here you could ask bartender where everyone is, or (because you are already
talking to the bartender) ask where everyone is. In fact, you can just type some
or all of the suggested topic, everyone and the game will figure out that it's
part of the ongoing conversation.]

[After each exchange, you are provided with a list of other things you might say
to continue the subject. There may be further topics you can discuss, however,
that are not suggested for puzzle or narrative reasons.]

"Right you are sir!" he says, with just a note of agitation. "Been like this for
too long, I say. But it's not like folks are going to go all dry, is it?" He
thinks for a moment. "Things will pick up, soon enough; they have to."

You bend down quite low to squeeze under the wooden beam as you make your way
into the game room.

Game Room
The main attraction of this room is a huge billiards table, centered in the
small space. Arrayed around this centerpiece are a few also-rans: a sad little
dartboard on the far side of the table from the rest of the pub, and a strange
little machine on a small shelf wedged into one corner.

The bartender watches you expectantly from the his preferred spot behind the
bar.

A cacacaphony of bells, chimes, and buzzers surges from the strange little
machine.

[Some objects, such as the billiards table, are big enough for you to stand on.

The beam itself, though large, is non-descript. It's position speaks to the
considerable age of the pub; the game room almost certainly had a different
purpose, originally, and was likely not connected to the pub.

A billiards table from a older, more grandious era, it is out of place in the
pub simply as a matter of its shear size and solidity. It has great legs of
carved mahogany, its blue felt is clean and unwrinkled, and the many pockets are
entirely unmarked by wear.

The machine sits on a shelf, at a height that would be comfortable if you were
seated in front of it, though you don't see a chair. There's a video screen that
displays a kaledescope of hearts, and coins, and lucky clovers, and pound
symbols, and other things you don't recognize. A collection of buttons on the
front apparently serve some purpose, perhaps when playing the game.
