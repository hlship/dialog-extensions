#outside-pub
(name *) Outside The Lamp And The Egg Pub
(room *)
(look *)
    You're on a narrow cobblestone path that threads between closely-set, squat stone houses.  It's
    just after sunset and, and in the dimness, you can make out a number of doors, all closed,
    and a few windows, all barricaded behind sturdy shutters.
    (par)
    The exception is the pub itself; through the somewhat dusty panes of the window you can make out a hint of
    light and movement.

#sign
(name *) Lamp and Egg Sign
(descr *)
    The sign depicts two disembodied hands; one holds an antique brass lamp; rays
    of light radiate out at uniform angles to form the the backdrop.
    In the other hand is a shiny gold egg decorated with intricate, baroque patterns.

        You glance down down with the odd feeling that you'll be surprised by what you see.

        No change since last time; you are still
    (stopping)
    %% How are we seeing our own hair and face?
    a tall, lean figure, with a shock of white hair over a clean-shaven and somewhat long face.

(name *)
    grey trousers
(dict *) wool woolen pair
(your *)
(pair *)
(descr *)
    An uremarkable pair of grey woollen trousers.
(prevent [remove *])
    That sounds somewhat unseemly.

#jacket
(wearable *)
(name *) frilly jacket
(your *)
(descr *)
    Your jacket is the height of fashion ... somewhere.  Crushed velour in an somewhat dramatic green, cut not too tightly 
    to give you freedom of movement; the wide lapels are in a dark red.

#key
(item *)
(name *) small key
(descr *)
    A small brass key on a short loop of string.

#pub-door
(door *)
(name *) pub door
(descr *)
    The door is fashioned from heavy wood darkened by time and use, with impressive brass fittings.

#window
(name *) windows
(dict *) pane panes glass
(plural *)
(descr *)
    The coolness brought on with the setting sun has left the windows nearly opaque with condensation on the inside,
    and the outside surface is a blaze of nearly microscopic scratches and pits. Even so, you can sense some warmth
    and movement inside.

%% This is just good enough for the bartender's reaction when you walk in, but it is clumsy.

    The pub's interior matches your every expectation. Dark wood, a well polished bar, several deep booths.
    Despite the early hour and chill outside, the pub is empty but for the bartender

        (stopping)
