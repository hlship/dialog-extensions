#outside-pub
(name *) Outside The Lamp And The Egg Pub
(proper *)
(room *)
(look *)
    You're on a narrow cobblestone path running north and south that threads between closely-set, squat stone houses.  It's
    just after sunset, and in the dimness, you can make out a number of doors, all closed,
    and a few windows, all barricaded behind sturdy shutters.
    (par)
    The exception is the pub on the east side of the path; under a rather involved bit of signage
    is quite the formidable door.
    Through the somewhat dusty panes of the flanking windows you can make out a hint of
    light and movement.

    The mist is thicker and heavier now, giving everything a hazy, unformed look.

#sign
(name *) Lamp and Egg Sign
(descr *)
    The sign depicts two disembodied hands; one holds an antique brass lamp; rays

#jacket
(wearable *)
(name *) frilly jacket
(your *)

    Your jacket is the height of fashion ... somewhere.  Crushed velour in an somewhat dramatic green, cut not too tightly 
    to give you freedom of movement; the wide lapels are in a dark red.

#key

    The door is fashioned from heavy wood darkened by time and use, with impressive brass fittings.

#windows
(name *) windows
(dict *) pane panes glass
(pair *)
(descr *)
    The coolness brought on with the setting sun has left the windows nearly opaque with condensation on the inside,
    and the outside surface is a blaze of nearly microscopic scratches and pits. Even so, you can sense some warmth
    and movement inside.
