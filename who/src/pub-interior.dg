#pub-interior
(name *) Inside the Pub
(room *)
(* attracts #pub-door/#window)
(look *)
    The pub's interior matches your every expectation. Dark wood, a well polished bar, several deep booths.
    Despite the early hour and chill outside, the pub is empty but for the bartender endlessly
    polishing the bar.

#bartender
(male *)
(name *) bartender
(dict *) man
(descr *)
    Younger than you'd think, he wears a lightly stained apron, and has rolled up the sleeves
    of his button-down shirt.
    He never seems to stop moving, even though he also seems rooted in place.
(narrate * expressing ignorance)
    "Not sure I follow you there" he says.
(beat $)
    He looks down for a bit, working his rag over a spot that looks mirror-smooth to you.
    (par)
(narrate greeting *)
    You catch the bartender's eye, and he's eager to engage with his only customer.

(name *) where everyone is
(command word *) everyone
(comment *)
    "Hey mate," you say, approaching the bar, "awfully quiet night in here, isn't it?"
(reply *)
    "Right you are sir!" he says, with just a note of agitation. "Been like this for too long, I say. But it's not
    like folks are going to go all dry, is it?"  He thinks for a moment. "Things will pick up, soon enough; they have to."


#booths
(actor container *)
(ignored by tutorial *)
(name *) deep wooden booths
(dict *) booth
(plural *)
(descr *)
    Each booth contains a pair of well-worn benches comfortably facing in towards each other, separated by a high table.
(prevent [enter *])
    Relaxing with a pint or two seems at odds with whatever your purpose is here.
