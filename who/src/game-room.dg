(room *)
(name *) Game Room
(look *)
    The main attraction of this room is a huge billiards table, centered in the small space. Arrayed around
    this centerpiece are a few also-rans: a sad little dartboard on the far side of the table from the rest of the pub,
    and a strange little machine on a small shelf wedged into one corner.
    (if) (#bartender is in scope)
    (then)
    (par) 
    The bartender watches you expectantly from the his preferred spot behind the bar.

(from * go #south to #pub-interior)
(* attracts #beam)
(narrate leaving * #south)
    You again duck under the low beam, back into the pub proper.

#billiards-table
(name *) billiards table
(dict *) pool 
(actor supporter *)
(descr *)
    A billiards table from a older, more grandious era, it is out of place in the pub simply as a matter
    of its shear size and solidity. It has great legs of carved mahogany,   
    its blue felt is clean and unwrinkled, and the many pockets are entirely
    unmarked by wear.
(prevent [climb *])
    (#bartender is in scope)
    (select)
    As you start to climb up on to the table, you are interrupted by the bartender.
    "Hold up then!" he says in, a much louder voice than he's used before,
    "What do you think you're up to?  I just got that felt refinished, and you're not
    to be getting it mucked up now then."
    (par)
    (or) (stopping)
    You obviously aren't going to climb up on the billiards table while he's watching.


#lamp
(name *) ceiling lamp
(descr *)
    A rectangular Tiffany lamp hangs from the ceiling; it is off-center with the table below, offset by a large and
    somewhat battered trap door mounted into the ceiling.

#trap-door
(name *) trap door
(dict *) handle
(openable *) 
(when * is out of reach)
    ~(#player is #on #billiards-table) 
    You can't reach the trap door from down here.
(descr *)
    (* is open) 
    The trap door is open, leading up into a very dim crawl space above the game room.
    That low beam separating the game room from the rest of the pub is still lower than the
    hanging door.
(descr *)
    Mounted into the ceiling, next to the lamp, is a sizable trap door; you presume it gives access to
    an upper floor, or more likely, a crawl-space above the game room.

#fruit-game
(name *) gambling machine
(dict *) fruit shelf screen buttons switch
(switchable *)
(descr *)
    The machine sits on a shelf, at a height that would be comfortable if you were seated in front of it, though you don't see
    a chair. 
    (if) (* is on) (then)
        There's a color video screen that displays a frenetic kaledescope of hearts, coins, lucky clovers, 
        pound symbols, and other things you don't recognize. 
    (else)
        The machine's video display is now peacefully dark.
    (endif)
    A collection of buttons on the front apparently serve some purpose, perhaps when playing the 
    game.
(* plays sounds)
    (* is on)
    (par)
    (select)
        A cacacaphony of bells, chimes, and buzzers surge from the strange little machine.
        (or)
        The annoying machine plays a short little tune, desperately trying to get your attention.
        (or)
        The gambling machine plays a triumpant fanfare, all buzzy electronic trumpets, then makes 
        a sound like a bucketful of coins spilling into its tray.
        (or)
        You hear the sound of rockets launching from the little machine in the corner, and see a
        fireworks display animated on its screen. The explosions fade to the word "WIN!".
        (or)
        The gambling machine falls silent for a moment, as if it's exhausted from all of
        its efforts to entice you to play.
        (if) (#sonic-screwdriver is pristine) (then)
        (par)
        In this moment of relative quiet, you can barely make out another sound ... an insistent
        high-pitched whine, strangely familar. The sound is muffled, as it appears to be coming
        from some place above the ceiling.
        (endif)
     (then at random)
(* plays sounds)
    (#sonic-screwdriver is pristine)
    (par)
    You can make out a muffled, electronic whine, coming from above you, past the ceiling.
(narrate switching off *)
    You reach behind the machine and toggle its power switch, bringing a pause to its
    endless cacapony.
(when play begins)
    (now) (* is on)
(perform [listen to *])
    (* is on)
    You can't help but listen to the machine, given the cacphony it is continuously making.
(perform [listen to *])
    Now that it's switched off, it doesn't make any sound at all, which is so vastly preferable.
(perform [search *])
    You check around and behind the machine searching for ... yes, an on/off switch is just 
    reachable on the back side of the machine.
(instead of [feel *])
        (try [search *])
(perform [push *])
    You punch at some of the buttons on the annoying machine, and nothing of note happens.
    (if) (* is off)
    (then)
        You doubt much more would happen if it were switched on.
    (endif)
