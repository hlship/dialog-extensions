#game-room 
(room *)
(name *) Game Room
(look *)
    The main attraction of this room is a huge billiards table, centered in the small space. Arrayed around
    this centerpiece are a few also-rans: a sad little dartboard on the far side of the table from the rest of the pub,
    and a strange little machine on a small shelf wedged into one corner.

(* attracts #beam)
(narrate leaving * #south)
    You again duck under the low beam, back into the pub proper.

    (par)
    A cacacaphony of bells, chimes, and buzzers come from the strange little machine.


#billiards-table
(name *) billiards table
(dict *) pool 
(actor supporter *)
(descr *)
    A billiards table from a older, more grandious era, it is out of place in the pub simply as a matter
    of its shear size and solidity. It has great legs of carved mahogany,   
    its blue felt is clean and unwrinkled, and the many pockets are entirely
    unmarked by wear.

#lamp
(name *) ceiling lamp
(descr *)
    A rectangular Tiffney lamp hangs from the ceiling; it is off-center with the table below, offset by a large and
    somewhat battered trap door mounted into the ceiling.

#trap-door
(name *) trap door
(dict *) handle
(openable *) 
(out of reach *)
    ~(#player is #on #billiards-table)
(descr *)
    (* is open) 
    The trap door is open, leaing up into a very dim crawl space above the game room.
    That low beam separating the game room from the rest of the pub is still lower than the
    hanging door.
(descr *)
    Mounted into the ceiling, next to the lamp, is a sizable trap door; you presume it gives access to
    an upper floor, or more likely, a crawl-space above the game room.

#fruit-game
(name *) gambling machine
(dict *) fruit shelf
(descr *)
    The machine sits on a shelf, at a height that would be comfortable if you were seated in front of it, though you don't see
    a chair.  There's a video screen that displays a kaledescope of hearts, and coins, and lucky clovers, and pound symbols, and
    other things you don't recognize. A collection of buttons on the front apparently serve some purpose, perhaps when playing the 
    game.

#dartboard
(name *) dartboard
(dict *) dart board
(descr *)
    The board is pocked by long use. You don't see any sign of any darts, however.
