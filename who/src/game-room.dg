#game-room 
(room *)
(name *) Game Room
(look *)
    The main attraction of this room is a huge billiards table, centered in the small space. Arrayed around
    this centerpiece are a few also-rans: a sad little dartboard on the far side of the table from the rest of the pub,
    and a strange little machine on a small shelf wedged into one corner.
    (if) (#bartender is in scope)
    (then)
    (par) 
    The bartender watches you expectantly from the his preferred spot behind the bar.

(from * go #south to #pub-interior)
(* attracts #beam)
(narrate leaving * #south)
    You again duck under the low beam, back into the pub proper.
(#lamp/#billiards-table/#trap-door/#fruit-game/#dartboard is #in *)
(on every tick in *)
    (par)
    A cacacaphony of bells, chimes, and buzzers surges from the strange little machine.

#billiards-table
(name *) billiards table
(dict *) pool 
(actor supporter *)
(descr *)
    A billiards table from a older, more grandious era, it is out of place in the pub simply as a matter
    of its shear size and solidity. It has great legs of carved mahogany,   
    its blue felt is clean and unwrinkled, and the many pockets are entirely
    unmarked by wear.
(prevent [climb *])
    (#bartender is in scope)
    (select)
    As you start to climb up to to the table, you are interrupted by the bartender.
    "Hold up then!" he says in a much louder voice than he's used before,
    "What do you think you're up to?  I just got that felt refinished, and you're not
    to be getting it mucked up now then."
    (par)
    (or) (stopping)
    You obviously aren't going to climb up on the table while he's watching.


#lamp
(name *) ceiling lamp
(descr *)
    A rectangular Tiffney lamp hangs from the ceiling; it is off-center with the table below, offset by a large and
    somewhat battered trap door mounted into the ceiling.

#trap-door
(name *) trap door
(dict *) handle
(openable *) 
(when * is out of reach)
    ~(#player is #on #billiards-table) 
    You can't reach the trap door from down here.

(descr *)
    (* is open) 
    The trap door is open, leaing up into a very dim crawl space above the game room.
    That low beam separating the game room from the rest of the pub is still lower than the
    hanging door.
(descr *)
    Mounted into the ceiling, next to the lamp, is a sizable trap door; you presume it gives access to
    an upper floor, or more likely, a crawl-space above the game room.

#fruit-game
(name *) gambling machine
(dict *) fruit shelf
(descr *)
    The machine sits on a shelf, at a height that would be comfortable if you were seated in front of it, though you don't see
    a chair.  There's a video screen that displays a kaledescope of hearts, and coins, and lucky clovers, and pound symbols, and
    other things you don't recognize. A collection of buttons on the front apparently serve some purpose, perhaps when playing the 
    game.

#dartboard
(name *) dartboard
(dict *) dart board
(descr *)
    The board is pocked by long use. You don't see any sign of any darts, however.
