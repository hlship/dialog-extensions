(story title) Penny Drop

(intro)
    Just wait here, we won't be but a minute.
    (par)
    (try [look])

#office
(room *)
(name *) Empty Office
(#player/#table is #in #office)
(look *)
    You've been left in this office to stew a bit before they are ready for your interview.
    To say it is bare-bones is an understatement. No windows, or even any furniture beyond a 
    single battered table.
    (if) (#penny-dropped in progress)
    (then)
        The edges of the floor are lit with a dim red light, and you can hear a low hum.
    (endif)

(current player #player)

#table
(supporter *)
(name *) table
(dict *) dented metal battered
(descr *) 
    A dented and dusty metal table.
    (if) (#penny is pristine)
    (then)
        Someone has left a shiny penny on the table.
    (endif)    
    (if) (#metronome is pristine)
    (then)
        Oddly, the only decoration in the room is a metronome sitting in one corner
        of the table.
    (endif)
(#penny/#metronome is #on *)


#penny
(item *)
(name *) shiny penny
(descr *)
    Not one of the valuable ones, but quite shiny given that the year of manufacture is quite a bit
    before you were even born.

#metronome
(item *)
(name *) metronome
(dict *) metro
(descr *)
    A small box with a kind of inverted pendulum standing up.  If it were pushed, it would
    start swinging back and forth at an even rate.
(after [push *])
    (now) (* is active)

#penny-dropped
(scene *)
(recurring *)
(start *) 
    (#penny is #in #office)
    (par)
    As the penny hits the floor, you hear a click and a low humming starts.
    A thin red line of illumination appears around the edges of the floor.
(complete *)
    ~(#penny is #in #office)
    (par)
    As you pick up the penny, there's another click, and the red illumination disappears.

#the-beat
(scene *)
(start *)
    (#metronome is active)
    As expected, the metronome's pendulum starts to swing back and forth.
(on every tick during *)
    (par)
    The metronome's pendulum swings to one extreme and there's an audible click.
