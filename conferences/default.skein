Conference Chamber
A low ceilinged chamber with a scattering of heavy wooden tables, perfect for
the exchange of information that can shape the course of history. Lavine is
already seated at the nearest table, and Thurg hovers nearby.

> talk lavine
You say hello to Lavine.

You could ask why she has come or say this alliance will be a happy one.

"I am so glad to see you," you tell Lavine, "I am sure the alliance of our two
peoples will be a long and happy one."

"That is my hope as well," she says musically.

Thurg roars in fury and begins to choke the life out of you, shouting "NO ELF-
HUMAN ALLIANCE" again and again.

     *** You have died. ***

Would you like to:
     UNDO the last move,
     RESTORE a saved position,
     QUIT the program,
     or RESTART from the beginning?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> ask why
"Why have you come?" you demand of Lavine urgently. You keep your voice as low
as you are able, but Thurg nonetheless watches you with obvious comprehension.

"Why, to see what it was you were saying to the trolls, of course," she answers
in a clear, bell-like tone. "Our alliance is still young, eh?"

Thurg roars in fury and begins to choke the life out of you, shouting "NO ELF-
HUMAN ALLIANCE" again and again.

     *** You have died. ***

Would you like to:
     UNDO the last move,
     RESTORE a saved position,
     QUIT the program,
     or RESTART from the beginning?
