(story title) Not As Simple

(intro)
    It is a long and riotous evening, full of
    unlikely stories and tall tales.
    But now, most of the patrons have gone away
    to their rooms to sleep, or have passed out
    before the fire.
    Even the two black bitch pups are curled on the
    hearth-stone, snuffling through tiny wet noses,
    and pawing the air in sleep. Now is the time to find out whether 
    the rumors that brought you to this neighborhood are true.

    The light is low and red. Above the fireplace hangs a map of this part of the Empire, and on the adjacent wall is the crimson and silver banner of Richard the Rose.
    The barmaid works her way from table to table, clearing away
    dishes and mugs.
    (par)
    A wanderer in grubby trousers slouches at the seat nearest the fire.

    "Oh, do they?" she says, sweeping crumbs of cheese

    "The oldest codger around these parts is old
    Garrick, and I would't put him beyond his four-score
    and ten."

    "That's true enough," says (the $NPC).
    "Though there are plenty around here that will deny it."

    "Down at the pig farm," she says. "The turn off is just before you come to the river, on the main road west.
    You can find it by the smell."

    She purses her lips and scrubs at a circle-shaped stain on the table before her. 
    "If you're a fool come looking for a spring of life or a vein of immortal gold buried in the black hills, 
    you'd do better to go back home where you come from."

    "What about yourself?" you ask. "Are you from around these parts?"

    "If by these parts you mean between the black hills
    and the river, no," she says. "I was born just at the far side of

        "I met last month a man that used to be a friend of my grandfather.
        My grandfather's long dead and in the ground, and this man looks
        younger than myself. I have a miniature painting of them two together,
        and I tell you he has not aged a moment."

        "I've told you all I know -- which is almost nothing," he says.
        "Only that I've met a man that has not aged since my
        grandfather's day, and maybe longer than that."
    (or)
        He tells you again about his encounter with this inplausibly
        young man, embellishing the story a little -- though not with
        any details that would help you find the fellow.

    "Why not?" He searches through the pockets of his coat, then the pockets of his trousers, and finally
    -- looking surprised and much relieved -- finds what he was looking for tucked away in his boot.
    "Here is is: have a look."
    (par)
    And he extends for view an old-fashioned locket: painted on an ivory rectangle are the images of
    two young men. 
    They are painted so small it would be hard to guarantee that you would recognize them again.
