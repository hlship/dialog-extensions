(room *)
(name *) Conference Chamber

    A low ceilinged chamber with a scattering of heavy wooden tables, perfect for
    the exchange of information that can shape the course of history.
    Lavine is already seated at the nearest table, and Thurg hovers nearby.

    Thurg roars in fury and begins to choke the life out of you,
    shouting "NO ELF-HUMAN ALLIANCE" again and again.

(* mentions #lavine/#meeting)
(comment *)
    "Why have you come?" you demand of Lavine urgently.
    You keep your voice as low as you are able, but Thurg
    nonetheless watches you with obvious comprehension.
(reply *)
    "Why, to see what it was you were saying to the trolls, of course,"
    she answers in a clear, bell-like tone.
    "Our alliance is still young, eh?"

#happy-aliance

(name *) this alliance will be a happy one
(* supplies #lavine)
(comment *)
    "I am so glad to see you," you tell Lavine, "I am sure the alliance of our
    two peoples will be a long and happy one."
(reply *)
    "That is my hope as well," she says musically.
