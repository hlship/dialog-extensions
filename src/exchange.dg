(story title)   The Exchange

(intro)
    Another miserable night in the London fog and rain. You have the package,
    and Malory is your contact ... but can he be trusted?
    (par)
    (try [look])

#foggy-alley
(room *)
(name *) Foggy Alley
(look *)
    You would be hard pressed to find a more cliche location for
    the drop off than this deserted alley. Fog billows in from somewhere,
    and a lone lamppost sheds minimal light. The sounds of bustling London 
    are distant.
    (par)
    Malory, your contact, stands just outside the weak cone of light from the lamppost.
    (notice #malory)
(#player is #in *)

%% In this example, there's only #malory as a CP, so there's no need to
%% do any ($ supplies $) rules.

#malory
(male *)
(name *) Agent Malory
(proper *)
(descr *)
    Malory would be a good agent, if he would just learn
    to not stand out in a crowd. His trenchcoat is just
    a bit too neatly pressed, his tie always looks freshly tied,
    and his shoes entirely lack in scuffs. He looks just a bit out of place
    in the kinds of seedy locations these kinds of exchanges take place in.
(* is #in #foggy-alley)
(narrate * greeting)
    (select)
    "Malory" is all you say. We're taught to keep these exchanges brief.
    (queue #have-you-got-it for *)
    (or)
    You nod your head in his direction, and he takes half a step forward to listen.
    (stopping)

#package
(item *)
(name *) briefcase
(dict *) package case brief
(descr *)
    A plain briefcase, containing who knows what -- that's above your pay grade.
    But given that they pulled you in from Berlin just for this exchange, it must
    be pretty important.
(* is #heldby #player)
(prevent [give * to $])
    { ~(pass phrase exchanged) (or) ~(safe house ok) }
    Protocol dictates that important assets should not be
    released until the responsible agent confirms security
    precautions.
(perform [give * to #malory])
    You hand the briefcase to Malory and catch a look of something -- greed? relief? annoyance?
    -- in his eyes.  He disappears down the alley and is lost immediately in the fog.
    (game over { The package has been delivered. Whether that's a triumph or a failure will be known soon. })
(prevent [drop *])
    The phrase "over my dead body" is usually an exaggeration.  In this case, it is chillingly accurate.
(prevent [open *])
    Excessive curiousity is not an admirable trait in an agent.

#have-you-got-it
(informative quip *)
(restrictive *)
(reply *)
    "Well," asks Malory, "do you have the package?"
    Always a bit too direct, this one, everything's so urgent, no sense of panache.
(nag *)
    Malory
    (select)
        grows impatient. "The package!" he insists.
    (or)
        raises his voice a hair. "A simple 'yes' or 'no' would do."
    (or)
        visibly seethes.
        "Out with it, man, I haven't got all day."
    (stopping)

#all-in-good-time
(informative quip *)
(* directly follows #have-you-got-it)
(name *) all in good time
(comment *)
    "All in good time, Malory.  There's a protocol to these things."
(reply *)
    "Home Office was very clear," he responds, "there's a timetable to keep."

#damnable-weather
(performative quip *)
(name *) comment on the weather
(comment *)
    "Damnable weather, isn't it?" You watch carefully to see how he reacts.
    Sometimes a careful facade starts to crumble when faced with something unexpected,
    such as a casual exchange in tense circumstances.
(reply *)
    "It's London," he replies, "the weather is always damnable. I'm not here for
    pleasantries." A solid response, but care must be taken.

#pleasantries
(questioning quip *)
(name *) what's wrong with pleasantries
(* directly follows #damnable-weather)
(comment *)
    "What's wrong with a few pleasantries?" you ask, pushing him a bit further.
    "They can make all the difference in this nasty business."
(reply *)
    Malory makes no response.
    You've been sizing him up, and he now seems to be doing the same.

#precautions
(questioning quip *)
(name *)
    if all precautions have been made
(* indirectly follows #all-in-good-time)
(comment *)
    "Fine, then. On to business," you begin, "have all proper precautions been taken?"
(reply *)
    Malory gives you a hard stare. 
    "Damn it, man. This is important -- what are you playing at?"

#safe-house
(questioning quip *)
(name *) whether the safe house is ready
(* indirectly follows #precautions)
(comment *)
    "The safe house, is it ready?" you inquire.
(reply *)
    Malory scoffs: "Yes, there's a safe house.
    No, I won't reveal its location.
    This is not a training exercise, why are you being so obtuse?"
    (now) (safe house ok)

#pass-phrase
(questioning quip *)
(name *) for the pass phrase
(* indirectly follows #precautions)
(comment *)
    "I'm certainly not handing over something this valuable without the proper pass phrase" you announce.
(reply *)
    Malory's eyes flash left and right, and he leans in close.
    He whispers the correct pass phrase almost unaudibly.
    You're somewhat relieved
    (if) ~(safe house ok)
    (then)
        , but you still have your orders
    (endif)
    .
    (now) (pass phrase exchanged)

(on every tick)
    (pass phrase exchanged)
    (safe house ok)
    (par)
    (select)
    Are you satisified?  Hard to say in this business. People have secrets,
    wheels within wheels. Still,
    (or)
    Begrudgingly,
    (stopping)
    it's time to hand him the package and hope for the best.
