(story title) The Beard

(intro)
    Portland's a small town, so you never know quite who you are going
    to run into.  You're old buddy Ted is waiting for the bus, and you haven't
    seen him in a while -- long enough for him to grow some serious facial hair.

(current player #player)

#ted
(name *)    Ted
(proper *)
(animate *)
(descr *)
    Somehow, since you last saw him, Ted has gone from
    baby-faced to lumberjack, at least in terms of
    facial hair.
(narrate greeting *)
    "Hey big man!" you say to Ted.  "Oh hey!  You take the 17 bus too?  I've never seen you here before." he replies.

#sidewalk
(name *)    Sidewalk
(room *)
(look *)
    Waiting for the bus at the sidewalk outside your office. You see your old friend Ted
    also waiting; you lost track of him a couple of gigs ago.  He looks changed, though.
(#player/#ted is #in *) 

#about-beard
(asking quip *)
(name *) about the beard
(comment *)
    "I've never seen you with a beard before" you say, "what's up with that?"
(reply *)
    "Just needed a change, I guess" Ted replies.

#ask-to-borrow-razor
(asking quip *)
(name *)    to borrow Ted's razor
(* follows #about-beard)
(comment *)
    "Hey Ted," you ask, "can I borrow your razor?  You're obviously not using it."
(reply *)
    Ted matches snark for snark. 
    "If I had a razor," he replies, "do you really think I would look like this?"

#sing-lumberjack-song
(performing quip *)
(name *)    sing the lumberjack song
(* follows #about-beard)
(comment *)
    You start to sing the Monty Python lumberjack song. "Oh, I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK, I sleep all night
    and I work all day..."
(reply *)
    Ted chimes in, skipping to the end: "I cut down trees. I wear high heels,
    suspendies, and a bra. I wish I'd been a girlie, Just like my dear Papa!"
    (par)
    You both chuckle a little, while the others waiting for the bus studiously avoid eye contact.

#girlfriend
(asking quip *)
(name *) if he has found a girlfriend
(dict *) girl
(* follows #about-beard)
(comment *)
    (if) (immediately following)
    (then)
        You have a sudden insight: "You dog, you found yourself a girlfriend, didn't you?"
    (else)
    "All kidding aside, do you have a girlfriend now?" you ask.
    (endif)
(reply *)
    (if) (immediately following)
    (then)
        "Uh, yes" he replies. "Why do you ask?"
    (else)
        "Is that really so surprising?" he responds.
    (endif)
