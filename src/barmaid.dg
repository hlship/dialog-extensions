(story title) Very Simple

(when play begins)
    It is a long and riotous evening, full of
    unlikely stories and tall tales.
    But now, most of the patrons have gone away
    to their rooms to sleep, or have passed out
    before the fire.
    Even the two black bitch pups are curled on the
    hearth-stone, snuffling through tiny wet noses,
    and pawing the air in sleep. Now is the time to find out whether 
    the rumors that brought you to this neighborhood are true.

    dishes and mugs.
