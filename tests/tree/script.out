Altar of the Tree of Knowledge
You have reached the altar of the Tree of Knowlege. The tree's branches rise up,
out of the deep ravine, towards the light; its roots have worked their way into
the living rock, and entagle the great stone altar.

> talk to tree
The voice of the tree eminates from all around. "You may ask about things
animal, vegetable, or mineral."

You could ask about animals, ask about plants, or ask about minerals.

What's a primate?

Larger brains, opposable thumbs. An interesting experiment you could say.

A moment passes.

You are a primate. Rather less well adapted than a chimp or a great ape, I
believe.

about fish.

Minerals are non-living elements, many of which are building blocks of life.
Metals, stone, and crystals are types of minerals.

metals, or ask about stone.

Mosses, land plants, and aquatic plants.
