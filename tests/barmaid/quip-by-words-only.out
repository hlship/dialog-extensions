It is a long and riotous evening, full of unlikely stories and tall tales. But
now, most of the patrons have gone away to their rooms to sleep, or have passed
out before the fire. Even the two black bitch pups are curled on the hearth-
stone, snuffling through tiny wet noses, and pawing the air in sleep. Now is the
time to find out whether the rumors that brought you to this neighborhood are
true.

The Inn
The light is low and red. Above the fireplace hangs a map of this part of the
Empire, and on the adjacent wall is the crimson and silver banner of Richard the
Rose. The barmaid works her way from table to table, clearing away dishes and
mugs.

> talk to barmaid
You say hello to the Bar Maid.

You could ask whether the rumors tell truly, or ask where the barmaid comes
from.

> truly
"Where I come from, over the black hills there, they say that men this side of
the mountain live as old as Methuselah," you remark. "They say the secret of
eternal life is here."

"Oh, do they?" she says, sweeping crumbs of cheese and crusty bread into her
hand. "The oldest codger around these parts is old Garrick, and I would't put
him beyond his four-score and ten."

You could ask where Garrick lives, ask where the barmaid comes from, or ask
whether she's heard the stories.

> heard
"Have you heard any stories of long-living men?" you press her.

She purses her lips and scrubs at a circle-shaped stain on the table before her.
"If you're a fool come looking for a spring of life or a vein of immortal gold
buried in the black hills, you'd do better to go back home where you come from."

You could ask where Garrick lives, or ask where the barmaid comes from.

> barmaid
"What about yourself?" you ask. "Are you from around these parts?"

"If by these parts you mean between the black hills and the river, no," she
says. "I was born just at the far side of the ford. But I came over here to
work."

You could ask where Garrick lives.

> lives
"Where does this old Garrick live?" you ask, trying not to seem too eager.

"Down at the pig farm," she says. "The turn off is just before you come to the
river, on the main road west. You can find it by the smell."
