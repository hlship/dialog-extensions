It is a long and riotous evening, full of unlikely stories and tall tales. But
now, most of the patrons have gone away to their rooms to sleep, or have passed
out before the fire. Even the two black bitch pups are curled on the hearth-
stone, snuffling through tiny wet noses, and pawing the air in sleep. Now is the
time to find out whether the rumors that brought you to this neighborhood are
true.

The Inn
The light is low and red. Above the fireplace hangs a map of this part of the
Empire, and on the adjacent wall is the crimson and silver banner of Richard the
Rose. The barmaid works her way from table to table, clearing away dishes and
mugs.

> ask barmaid about rumors
You say hello to the Bar Maid.

"Where I come from, over the black hills there, they say that men this side of
the mountain live as old as Methuselah," you remark. "They say the secret of
eternal life is here."

"Oh, do they?" she says, sweeping crumbs of cheese and crusty bread into her
hand. "The oldest codger around these parts is old Garrick, and I would't put
him beyond his four-score and ten."

You could ask where Garrick lives, ask where the barmaid comes from, or ask
whether she's heard the stories.
