Portland's a small town, so you never know quite who you are going to run into.
You're old buddy Ted is waiting for the bus, and you haven't seen him in a
while--long enough for him to grow some serious facial hair.

Sidewalk
Waiting for the bus at the sidewalk outside your office. You see your old friend
Ted also waiting; you lost track of him a couple of gigs ago. He looks changed,
though.

> talk ted
"Hey big man!" you say to Ted. "Oh hey! You take the 17 bus too? I've never seen
you here before." he replies.

You could ask about the beard.

> ask beard
"I've never seen you with a beard before" you say, "what's up with that?"

"Just needed a change, I guess" Ted replies.

You could ask to borrow Ted's razor, ask if he has found a girlfriend, or sing
the lumberjack song.

> a girlfriend
You have a sudden insight: "You dog, you found yourself a girlfriend, didn't
you?"

"Uh, yes" he replies. "Why do you ask?"

You could ask to borrow Ted's razor or sing the lumberjack song.
