Conference Chamber
A low ceilinged chamber with a scattering of heavy wooden tables, perfect for
the exchange of information that can shape the course of history. Lavine is
already seated at the nearest table, and Thurg hovers nearby.

> talk lavine
You say hello to Lavine.

You could ask why she has come or say this alliance will be a happy one.

> happy
"I am so glad to see you," you tell Lavine, "I am sure the alliance of our two
peoples will be a long and happy one."

"That is my hope as well," she says musically.

Thurg roars in fury and begins to choke the life out of you, shouting "NO ELF-
HUMAN ALLIANCE" again and again.

     *** You have died. ***

Would you like to:
     UNDO the last move,
     RESTORE a saved position,
     QUIT the program,
     or RESTART from the beginning?
