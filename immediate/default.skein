Portland's a small town, so you never know quite who you are going to run into.
You're old buddy Ted is waiting for the bus, and you haven't seen him in a
while--long enough for him to grow some serious facial hair.

Sidewalk
Waiting for the bus at the sidewalk outside your office. You see your old friend
Ted also waiting; you lost track of him a couple of gigs ago. He looks changed,
though.

"Hey big man!" you say to Ted. "Oh hey! You take the 17 bus too? I've never seen
you here before." he replies.

You could ask about the beard.

"I've never seen you with a beard before" you say, "what's up with that?"

"Just needed a change, I guess" Ted replies.

You could ask to borrow Ted's razor, ask if he has found a girlfriend, or sing
the lumberjack song.

> lumberjack
You start to sing the Monty Python lumberjack song. "Oh, I'm a lumberjack and
I'm OK, I sleep all night and I work all day..."

Ted chimes in, skipping to the end: "I cut down trees. I wear high heels,
suspendies, and a bra. I wish I'd been a girlie, Just like my dear Papa!"

You both chuckle a little, while the others waiting for the bus studiously avoid
eye contact.

You could ask to borrow Ted's razor or ask if he has found a girlfriend.

"All kidding aside, do you have a girlfriend now?" you ask.

"Is that really so surprising?" he responds.

You could ask to borrow Ted's razor.

You have a sudden insight: "You dog, you found yourself a girlfriend, didn't
you?"

"Uh, yes" he replies. "Why do you ask?"

You could ask to borrow Ted's razor or sing the lumberjack song.
