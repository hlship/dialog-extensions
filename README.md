# Threaded Conversation

This library adds threaded conversation with non-player characters (NPCs) to
[Dialog](https://linusakesson.net/dialog/index.php).

It is deeply indebted to
[Threaded Conversation for Inform 7](https://github.com/i7/extensions/tree/master/Chris%20Conley)
by Emily Short, Chris Conley, and many more.

This implementation borrows terminology and ideas from the original work, but is not a direct translation.

# Distribution

Currently, just get a copy of `lib/threaded-conversation.dg` and add it to your workspace and
ensure it is loaded when building or debugging.

# Using Threaded Conversation

(forthcoming)

# Status

Early days yet, but showing some progress.

Basic conversations are working reasonably well, but queued quips are quite limited and only barely
implemented.
