# TODO

## TC

- Startup checks similar to Inform7 (prevent unexpected loops, etc.)
- Optimizations (that may only be needed in full size games)
- Tune the logic for in-thread vs. out-of-thread
- Multi-way conversation (e.g., other present NPCs may have queued quips)
- `(queue $Quip last for $NPC as $Precedence)`
